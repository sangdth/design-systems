1. Human side
	- Motor skill
	- Effect
2. Machine side
	- Input latency (keyboard, mouse, gloves, sensors)
	- Debounce, USB etc
	- Processing: OS, browser

We don't take this serious with mouse and keyboard, but with new tech like AR/VR, we should make sure the input from gloves/sensors have acceptable latency.
