# Markdown Quality Rules

## Core Requirements

1. **Follow markdownlint rules** - Zero warnings in output
2. **Apply GitHub Markdown standards** - Use GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) conventions
3. **Fix all linting warnings** - Before delivering any markdown content

## Key Practices

**Structure:**

- One H1 (`#`) per document, at the top
- No skip-level headings (don't jump from H1 to H3)
- Blank line before/after headings, lists, code blocks
- End files with single newline

**Lists:**

- Consistent markers (either `*` or `-`, not mixed)
- Indent nested items by 2-4 spaces
- Blank lines between list items with multiple paragraphs

**Code:**

- Always specify language for fenced code blocks
- Use backticks for inline code: `variable`
- Indent code blocks consistently

**Links & Images:**

- Use reference-style links for repeated URLs
- Descriptive alt text for images
- No bare URLs - always use link syntax

**Whitespace:**

- No trailing spaces (except line breaks: two spaces)
- No multiple consecutive blank lines
- Maximum line length: 80-120 characters (when practical)

### Additional Best Practices

- **Escape special characters** when literal (`\*`, `\_`, etc.)
- **Tables**: Use proper alignment, consistent spacing
- **Emphasis**: `*italic*` and `**bold**` (not `_` variants for consistency)
- **Task lists**: `- [ ]` and `- [x]` for checkboxes

### Validation

Run through a linter (markdownlint, remark-lint) before considering complete.
