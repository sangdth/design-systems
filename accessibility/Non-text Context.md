Icons and other assets should provide explicit alt text to users so that screen readers can accurately recognise them.

Users must be able to perceive information and user interface components that are presented to them.

## [WCAG guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=144&currentsidebar=%23col_overview#principle1 "How to Meet WCAG (Quickref Reference)")

-   **Text Alternatives:** Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.
-   **Time-based Media:** Provide alternatives for time-based media.
-   **Adaptable:** Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure.
-   **Distinguishable:** Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background.
